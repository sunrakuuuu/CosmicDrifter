# Cosmic Drifter

Cosmic Drifter is a simple student game dev project.
It is a 2D space shooter you can play in the browser, but it is designed with mobile-style controls in mind.

## About

This project was built as a learning project for beginner game development.
The goal is to keep things fun and clear rather than overly complex.

In the game, you fly a ship, avoid enemy attacks, and survive while collecting score and power-ups.

## Game Modes

- Story Mode: Play through levels and boss fights.
- Endless Mode: Survive as long as you can and chase a high score.

## Controls

- Mobile / touch: Press and drag on the screen to move your ship.
- Desktop: Use `WASD` or arrow keys to move.
- Pause: Press `P` or use the pause button.

## Run Locally

### 1. Install dependencies

## Tech Stack
